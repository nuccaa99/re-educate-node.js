// 1) Fetch data from this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
// Parse the data so that each object contains only four properties: id, name, username, and email.
// Write the resulting array to a file called users.json.

// 2) Run the command node main.js Ferrari 2020 red, retrieve the data from process.argv,
// and build a car object with the properties id, carModel, carColor, and carReleaseDate.
// Append this object to cars.json. Each time you run this command, a new object should be added to cars.json, 
// so if you run it five times, you should have five objects in the file.

// 3) Write a random text into a file named text.txt. Then, read this file and count how many vowels are present.
